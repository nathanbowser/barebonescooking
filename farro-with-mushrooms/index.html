<p>This is a great little side dish! Let me start by telling you about farro. It is one of my new favorite grains! The thing that I love about it is its texture and its chewiness. In my opinion, it is more interesting than quinoa and couscous. Don’t get me wrong - I love those as well, but quinoa is lacking texture and couscous can just be boring sometimes.  That is where farro comes in - to spice things up!</p>

<p>The definition of farro, straight from the wikipedia article is : “a food composed of the grains of certain wheat species. The exact definition is debated.” So you’ll just have to trust me and try it yourself! I find it in my local supermarket with the rice and the grains, but you can sometimes find it in the bulk bins of certain health food stores.</p>

<p>I have been experimenting with it lately, and it can really stand up to most “dressings” and ingredients. Here, I tried to make it a savory side to go with the salmon and asparagus we were having for dinner.  The garlic butter is fantastic and really soaks into the farro. Who doesn’t love garlic butter slathered on anything and everything?</p>

<p>Next, I want to take some time to talk about the mushrooms. Mushrooms can be a finicky ingredient if not prepared properly. After some testing around, I think I have found a delicious way to bring out their flavor. Just want to give a shout-out to my friend Kelly for helping me perfect this technique. More on that below…</p>

<ul>
<li>2 cups farro</li>
<li>4 cups low sodium chicken stock</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1 package mushrooms - any kind you like</li>
<li>½ stick of butter</li>
<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>⅓ cup cooking sherry - available in the supermarket</li>
</ul>

<p>Begin by bringing the chicken stock and water to boil in a medium sauce pan. I like to always use low sodium chicken stock so I can control the amount of salt in the recipe. Once boiling, add in farro and some salt. You can adjust this later if you didn't add enough. One thing about farro, is that all the liquid does not have to evaporate like it does for rice. Most of the time, you have to drain the farro at the end of cooking it. After you add the farro in, reduce the heat to a simmer and put a lid on it. It will need to cook about 30 minutes until tender but still chewy.</p>

<p>While the farro is cooking , slice your mushrooms if they are not already sliced and heat a saute pan on medium high heat. Put the mushrooms in the pan DRY. No oil, no salt, nothing to begin with. Mushrooms have liquid in them, and when you salt them early, they get watery. Give the mushrooms a few minutes to soften, then they will release liquid for a few minutes and dry up and begin to stick to the pan. At this point, after about 10 minutes, add in the sherry and let the mushrooms cook until they are dry again. Add in salt and a good dose of fresh cracked black pepper. Set aside until farro is done.</p>

<p>In a small saucepan, heat the butter and grate in your garlic using a microplane. You could also just mince finely. Let them melt together.</p>

<p>Drain your farro, place it in a bowl, and then pour the hot garlic butter over top. Smells so good! Top the bowl with the sauted mushrooms and dig in!</p>
