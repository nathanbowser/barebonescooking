<p>This is a simple, delicious, and fresh meal. Mussels are something that most people probably only eat when they are out at a restaurant. However, they could not be easier to make at home! Whenever I see mussels on sale, I snatch them up. This meal comes together in under 30 minutes and can be served as an appetizer or a meal on its own.</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>1 leek (only white part) - sliced</li>
<li>3 cloves of garlic - minced</li>
<li>1 cup white wine (can use chicken broth instead)</li>
<li>1 lemon</li>
<li>1 bag mussels - 2 lbs</li>
<li>cleaned, rinsed, beard removed</li>
<li>crusty bread for dipping</li>
</ul>

<p>Mussel Prep:</p>

<p>When you get your mussels, sometimes they involve some prep on your part. The first thing I do is remove them from the bag and run them under cold water. Scrub them it make sure you get the grit off of the outside. Also, mussels have a “beard” which is a stingy bunch that hang on the outside of the shell. Sometimes these are removed, sometimes you have to remove them. This is an important step because they can be gritty and add an unpleasant taste to the sauce and the mussels. Once the mussels are cleaned, add them to a large bowl and cover with ice and set the in the refrigerator until you are ready to use them.</p>

<p>Leek Prep:</p>

<p>Since leeks grow in the dirt, they involve some extra prep work to make sure they are clean before you add them to your meal. You only use the white stems of the leeks, so chop off the large leafy tops and discard them. Then, slice the leeks into thin rounds and add them to large bowl with water. As you add them, separate the rings to be sure you get the dirt out of the rings. Submerge the leeks in water and let them sit for a little bit to be sure the dirt all falls to the bottom. Then drain them over a strainer and rinse one last time.</p>

<p>Mince your garlic, open your wine, and slice your lemon. At this point, the meal comes together in under 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter into a heavy bottomed large pot. Add the leeks and saute for 5-7 minutes until soft. Add in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Next, add in the white wine and let it cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Ad din mussels and give the pan a big shake a few times to mix everything. Add the lid and let the mussels steam about 3-5 minutes depending on the size. Once they are all open, they are done!</p>

<p>I like to transfer the mussels to a large bowl, add a squeeze of lemon and serve with toasted, crispy garlic bread for all that delicious sauce.</p>
