<p>Today’s recipe is a special one because I created it for my husband's birthday.  This is a collaboration of two of Nate’s favorite things: stuffed shells and the Italian combination of sausage, broccoli rabe, and provolone.  Let’s face it, stuffed shells is not something you make on a regular basis, as it can be time consuming.  But let me tell you this, on a Sunday afternoon with time to spare, it can be fun! Open up a bottle of wine, slice up a baguette and you have yourself a lovely evening. </p>

<p>As with most of my recipes, things can be swapped and adjusted to your taste. Broccoli rabe can be extremely bitter, you either hate it or love it. If you dislike it, spinach would be a great swap. Just make sure you get extra since it cooks down a great deal. We like the spicy sausage in this house, but the sweet italian sausage would make a nice stuffed shell as well. As far as sauce goes, just use your favorite and you can use as little or as much as you want.</p>

<p>Consider this for your next birthday dinner!</p>

<ul>
<li>1 lb spicy Italian sausage - can substitute sweet sausage</li>
<li>1 bunch of broccoli rabe - stems removed</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves - minced</li>
<li>½ cup part skim ricotta cheese</li>
<li>⅓ cup parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 box (1 lb) of large shells</li>
<li>freshly grated provolone cheese, just a bit for the top</li>
<li>approximately 3 cups of your favorite basic marinara sauce</li>
</ul>

<p>Set oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>Set a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. While waiting, squeeze the sausage out of the casing. If bulk sausage is available in the market, choose that, as it is easier to break up and saute. Cook sausage over medium heat and break up into smaller pieces while it is cooking. Once cooked through, remove from the pan and put into a large bowl to cool. Using the same pan, add olive oil and saute the broccoli rabe. All I did to prepare the broccoli was cut off the stems and then cut the tops a few more times so the pieces are more manageable. This will cook down similar to spinach. After about 5-7 minutes and once wilted, add salt, pepper, and the garlic. Saute for another 2-3 minutes and then remove from heat and add to the bowl with the sausage.</p>

<p>Let the mixture cool a bit, and then add both cheeses, the egg, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well and that is your filling!</p>

<p>Cook pasta according to package instructions, but make sure you pull just short of finished, (al dente) since the pasta will cook more in the oven. Drain pasta. Next, it is time to stuff your shells. </p>

<p>Stuff about a tablespoon of filling into each shell and set side by side in a baking dish. You do not want the shells to be overfilled, but just stuffed to the brim. Once all the shells are stuffed and in the pan, grate provolone cheese over the top.  Cover the shells with as much marinara sauce as you prefer and then grate more provolone cheese on top of that.  You can never have too much cheese in an Italian meal!  Cover the shells in foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and let the shells crisp up a bit, 10 - 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Serve with more marinara sauce and a crusty baguette.</p>
