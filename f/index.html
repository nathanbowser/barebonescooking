<p>Flounder! I must say, this is a new fish for me. It all started 2 weeks ago when my family and I went on a birthday dinner for my mom and I. Our birthdays are a month apart, so we settled on a date in the middle. We chose an Italian restaurant and the first special of the night was Flounder Puttanesca. I thought to myself - “I will definitely not be having that, I am not even sure if I like flounder”. My brother decided to order that special and after tasting all of the meals, we unanimously voted his meal as the best meal of the night! There you have it, try new things and they may become new favorites.</p>

<p>Puttanesca sauce is not even something I have often, but it really is simple and delicious. It has a nice salty, briny flavor. I was able to recreate this dish pretty easily and I wanted to share it because it is easy enough for a weeknight meal, but also special enough for a dinner party. </p>

<p>There is one ingredient I would like to address - the anchovies. I think some people may be opposed to trying this in the recipe, but I want to assure you that it will not give the sauce a “fishy” taste. What it will do, is give the sauce an added saltiness and really compliment the flounder. The anchovies basically melt into the sauce and there are not large pieces or bites. You will basically not even know they are in there. I would advise you to try them!</p>

<ul>
<li>4 flounder fillets, or approximately 1 pound</li>
<li>⅓ cup flour, for dusting</li>
<li>canola oil for frying</li>
<li>1 large can whole peeled tomatoes (28 oz)</li>
<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup pitted kalamata olives</li>
<li>anchovies packed in oil - 4-5 small fillets </li>
<li>3 oz capers, ~ 3 tbsp</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, grated or minced fine</li>
<li>1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
<li>1 lb pasta - your choice, we used angel hair</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove flounder and dry the fillets. Add salt and pepper to both sides and then dip each fillet into the flour. You want a light dusting on the fish. Add canola oil to a heavy bottomed pan about an inch up the side. You want to do a shallow fry and not submerge the whole fish in oil. My fillets were pretty thin, so they only needed 3 minutes per side. When you remove them from the oil, put them on a paper-towel lined plate to soak any excess oil.</p>

<p>Add olive oil to a skillet over medium low heat.  Add in the sardine fillets and let them cook in the oil. Using a wooden spoon, break them apart. They will melt into the oil and sauce and you will not have chunks in there after a few minutes.  Add in the garlic and let everything cook for a minute.  Add in capers and cook for another minute. Next, use your hands to crush the whole tomatoes as you add them into the pan. This way, you will have smaller, bite-sized chunks of tomatoes in the sauce. Let the sauce come to a simmer to incorporate all the flavors. After a few minutes, add in the red pepper flakes (if using) and the calamata olives. The sauce doesn’t need to cook much after this, but I would simmer it for a few minutes. </p>

<p>At this point, you can add the pasta into the sauce to mingle. Or, if you prefer, you can serve the pasta topped with sauce, then the fish on top of that and more sauce to finish. I added the pasta into the sauce then served it with a piece of fish on top and more sauce over the whole dish. It was really delicious, fresh, salty, and wonderful!</p>
