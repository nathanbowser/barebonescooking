<p>These burgers are a great treat! Sometimes it is so nice and comforting to make your own fancy burgers at home on the grill.  You can cook them how you like them and the topping possibilities are endless. I just made these beauties for Sunday night dinner after a weekend of working. It was the perfect cap to end the weekend. </p>

<p>I wanted to do something a little different and play with some topping ideas and flavor combos. These flavors compliment each other perfectly for a truly amazing burger. There are 2 types of burger making styles. The type where you add ingredients into the meat mixture and keep the toppings basic. Or the type where you keep the burger meat plain and make the toppings count. My husband and I are more into making the latter version. We keep our burger meat simple with a good dose of salt and fresh cracked black pepper and we let the toppings shine through. You can taste the delicious, juicy meat and the toppings really help to round out the flavor of each bite. </p>

<p>These burgers are first topped with gruyere cheese which is arguably one of the most delicious melty cheeses and perfect as a burger topper. I took shallots and sliced them thin, threw them in some flour, and shallow fried them in vegetable oil for a great salty crunch. The sauce is genius - equal parts of mayo and BBQ sauce for a creamy and tangy bite. The arugula is peppery and helps to offset the sweet BBQ sauce. Together, this makes for the perfect burger bite!</p>

<p>I hope you will make these before summer ends, I promise they will not disappoint! The nice thing is that you can adapt this recipe to feed just 2 people or a whole party of people easily.  They come together quick and will definitely be memorable. </p>

<ul>
<li>1 lb ground meat (for 4 - or you can adjust for more or less)</li>
<li>burger buns of your choice</li>
<li>gruyere cheese</li>
<li>½ cup of arugula</li>
<li>3 shallots, sliced thin</li>
<li>½ cup flour - for dredging</li>
<li>~ 1 cup vegetable oil for shallow frying</li>
<li>¼ cup favorite BBQ sauce</li>
<li>¼ cup mayo</li>
</ul>

<p>Begin by prepping your ingredients. The shallots will take the most time and prep. Heat the vegetable oil on medium heat on the stove until just before boiling.  Peel the shallots and slice them into thin rounds. Add them into the flour and lightly coat them. Once the oil is ready, drop some into the oil, but do not crowd the pan. I did these in about 3 batches. Shallow fry the shallots until brown and crispy. Once finished, add them to a paper-towel lined plate to catch the drippings. Salt them immediately after removing from the oil.</p>

<p>Set the shallots aside. Get the arugula ready by washing and drying the leaves and set them aside as while. For the sauce, mix together BBQ sauce and mayo.</p>

<p>For the burgers, add salt and pepper to the meat and mix with your hands quickly. Form the burgers into patties based on the size you would like. Cook the burgers on medium heat on your grill until desired doneness. </p>

<p>I snagged this neat little chart from food network to give you their recommended cooking temperatures. You can always cut into it to check if you don’t have a thermometer, but I highly recommend using a meat thermometer for perfect cooking.</p>

<p>Beef : Food Network Recommendation <br>
Rare = 125 + 3 minute rest <br>
Medium Rare = 130-135 <br>
Medium = 135-140 <br>
Medium Well = 140-150 <br>
Well = 155 + <br>
Ground = 160</p>

<p>When burgers are almost done, add cheese so it melts. Toast buns on grill, if desired.</p>

<p>To assemble burgers : Add meat/cheese to the bun, then add arugula, then shallots, and the BBQ mayo on the top. Dig in!</p>
