<p>This weekend we celebrated my Dad’s birthday. His one request was that we have a BBQ at his house and everyone makes something. My brother had a menu in mind, so we all split up the dishes evenly. My dad made the steak and lobster, my mom made the chimichurri sauce and sides, my brother made a summer grilled corn salad, Nate made fresh baked bread and trout dip, and I made an appetizer and this dessert! It was so much fun to have this delicious meal come together with everyones help. Everyone had one thing in mind: what does Dad like? That is exactly what inspired this dessert. I wanted to create something summery that my dad would love. Mission accomplished! Blueberry and lemon is a classic flavor combo that we all love. These bars were easy to make and were a great summer treat. They taste even better the next day.</p>

<p>Graham CrackerCrust </p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup graham crackers - crushed</li>
<li>½ stick butter - melted</li>
<li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream Cheese Layer</p>

<ul>
<li>2 8oz packages of cream cheese - softened </li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>½ cup sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Blueberry Pie Layer</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pint fresh blueberries</li>
<li>the zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Set oven to 325.</p>

<p>To make the crust : either use a food processor to grind the graham crackers or you can place in a large bag and crush them. Melt the butter and mix the 2 together. Press the mixture into an 8 x 8 square baking dish. I usually spray my dish with PAM non-stick cooking spray to be safe.</p>

<p>For the cream cheese layer : using a food processor or hand mixer, blend the ingredients together. Once blended until smooth, spread evenly on top of graham cracker crust. Place in the oven on 325 degrees for about 30 minutes, until cooked through.</p>

<p>While the bars are baking, make the blueberry filling. In a small saucepan, put blueberries, sugar, and lemon zest in. Heat for about 5 minutes until simmering. Then, add cornstarch and let the mixture simmer for about 5 more minutes until it starts to thicken.</p>

<p>Once the pan comes out of the oven, let it cool slightly. Pour blueberry filling on top to cover the cream cheese layer. At this point, it is best to put in the fridge to chill. Once chilled, you can add more lemon zest on top. Cut the bars into squares and enjoy! We found that they were actually better the second day because everything had a chance to firm up. A great make-ahead summer dish!</p>
