<p>If there is one more homemade and delicious meal you make this summer, let this be it! This lasagna takes the bounty of delicious produce that summer has to offer and lets it shine. There is no pasta. There is no meat. There is not even any sauce. It is vegetable lasagna and the vegetables rule.</p>

<p>Due to my hectic work schedule and the fact that I work every other weekend, I realized I had not had a chance to head to my favorite farmers market,  <a href="http://thefoodtrust.org/farmers-markets/market/headhouse">Headhouse Farmers' Market</a>. Due to Nate’s unfortunate luck on his bicycle last Sunday, we both found ourselves free around 11 am and got to go to the market together. Let me tell you this - the farmers market was kickin’! It was packed, they added even more vendors, and the produce was all fresh, ripe, and abundant. It was fantastic.</p>

<p>I have had this idea in my mind for some time now, but did not have any of the logistics set. I set out down the aisle of the farmers market to see what looked best and I would take it from there. The fruit was exceptional and we stocked up on that. The tomatoes were all different colors, shapes, and sizes. I got so many different tomatoes that I decided to use fresh, ripe tomatoes as the “sauce”. The squash, eggplants, and peppers were freshly picked and brightly colored. When we returned home, I had a cornucopia of fresh produce to turn into a delicious Sunday Night Dinner. There is something about cooking a long and lavish meal on a Sunday to end the week on a great note and get ready for the upcoming week ahead.</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t51.2885-15/11201580_1051113171585935_252672865_n.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto;  width: 680px"></p>

<p>This is certainly not a quick meal (what lasagna ever is?). It is certainly not a meal I would recommend making outside of the season. The reason this works is because the vegetables are at their peak ripeness and the tomatoes are bursting with flavor. I also find it refreshing to have comfort food like this with a seasonal twist. It has all the comfort of lasagna, but will not weigh you down. And that is what summer cooking is all about!</p>

<p>Ingredients </p>

<ul>
<li>2 yellow squash</li>
<li>2 zucchini</li>
<li>2 eggplants</li>
<li>2 red or yellow peppers</li>
<li>4-5 large ripe tomatoes</li>
<li>handful fresh basil</li>
<li>mozzarella cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>Filling</p>

<ul>
<li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves - grated</li>
<li>2 eggs - lightly beaten</li>
<li>⅓ cup parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 bag sauted spinach (will wilt down to about ¼ cup)</li>
</ul>

<p>Prep :</p>

<p>The eggplant will take the longest to prep, so start with that. Slice the eggplant in long planks. In order to remove the bitter flavor, salt the eggplant on one side and place it in a strainer or on a cookie sheet to drain. Let it drain on one side for about 20-30 minutes. Then, flip it and re-salt and let the other side drain. Lay a kitchen towel down and dry each side of the eggplant to remove all the moisture. Brush the eggplant with olive oil and sprinkle on some black pepper.</p>

<p>For the peppers, you will roast them. Char them on the grill until black all around, Then, place them in a brown pepper bag to sweat. After 20 minutes, remove the black part to reveal the roasted pepper.</p>

<p>For the zucchini and squash, slice them in planks, relatively the same size. Then brush them with olive oil, and sprinkle salt and pepper.</p>

<p>For the tomatoes, slice them into thick rounds and sprinkle them with salt. This will take the place of a traditional “sauce”, so it is important to have juicy and ripe tomatoes.</p>

<p>For the filling, begin by sauteing the spinach in a little olive oil with salt and pepper. Then, mix everything together and set aside.</p>

<p>Grill the eggplant, zucchini, squash. Slice the peppers and get everything set.</p>

<p>Assembly:</p>

<p>Set oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t51.2885-15/11899706_162092424123435_922243921_n.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto;  width: 680px"></p>

<p>Once all the veggies are prepped, start the assembly. Using a 13 by 9 inch pan - drizzle olive oil on the bottom. Here are the layers :</p>

<p>eggplant // ricotta cheese mix // tomato // basil <br>
zucchini // ricotta cheese mix  //tomato // basil <br>
squash // ricotta cheese mix //tomato // basil <br>
mozzarella cheese // peppers // parmesan cheese</p>

<p>Cover the lasagna in foil and bake it for 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and broil it for 3-5 minutes until the cheese starts to bubble. Serve with toasted baguette to sop up the juices.</p>

<p>I hope you all will take the time to hit the farmers market or farm stand and enjoy the flavors summer had to offer!</p>
